I build scalable solutions with focus and a commitment to continuous learning.

I’m dependable and dedicated to writing clear, maintainable code. I enjoy tackling challenges and expanding my skills along the way. Practicality and growth guide how I approach every project.

Outside of work, I enjoy self-hosting stuff with my homelab and writing [articles](https://medium.com/@jamesesguerra025). I’m also currently working on a book about self-hosting — you can check it out [here](https://diy-cloud-book.vercel.app/). Most of all, I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend.
